# Sample-Code

In this repository are a few examples of how I like to structure my code and visualize data. The HTML files of the R-markdown documentation are included to nicely format the data analysis, images, and allow for reproducible results. I often create R-markdown files when explaining steps to non-coders/non-computational biologists. These are examples of two R-markdown files.   

- generateCorrMat is an example of a function I wrote and use to generate a correlation matrix, which is used as an adjacency matrix for downstream network analysis. 
- PCAxenopusLineages markdown file was created myself for the purposes of sharing with experimental scientists at Northwestern.

Please note, my thesis work is more sophisticated and structured on github as a downloadable package. However, this work has not been submitted for publication (yet!), and therefore that code exists in a private repository.
